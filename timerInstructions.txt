Set Up the Basic Structure of the C++ Program

Begin by creating a new C++ program with a basic structure, including the main() function.
Include the Necessary Libraries

Include the <windows.h> library, which provides the Sleep function:
    #include <windows.h>

Create Variables for User Input

Declare variables to hold the userâ€™s inputs for Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. These variables will be used to set the countdown timer.
Get User Input for the Timer

Use a while loop to prompt the user to input values for Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
Inside the loop, introduce an if statement to ensure the user input is valid.
If the input is invalid, prompt the user to re-enter the values.
If the input is valid, use break; to exit the loop.
Create the Countdown Timer Logic

Add another while loop with a condition that will continue running until the timer reaches 0 for Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.
Inside this loop:
Use system("cls"); to clear the output screen before displaying the timer.
Display the current time remaining in the format Hour : Minute : Seconds.
Use the Sleep(1000); function to pause the program for 1 second, creating the countdown effect.
Countdown Logic

Implement the countdown logic within the loop:
If Seconds is greater than 0, decrement Seconds.
If Seconds is 0 but Minutes is greater than 0, set Seconds to 59 and decrement Minutes.
If both Minutes and Seconds are 0 but Hours is greater than 0, set Minutes to 59, Seconds to 59, and decrement Hours.
End the Countdown

Example Code: 

    While loop {
        system("cls"); // clear the screen
        // display hour : minute : seconds 
        Sleep(1000); // pauses the program for 1 second 

        if (second >0){
            second --;
        }
        else if (minute > 0){
            second = 59;
            minute--;
        }
        else if (hour >0){
            minute = 59;
            seconds 59;
            hour --;
        }
    }
